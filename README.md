# Hacklab Jyv채skyl채 web site development repository

Website (2021 remake) is currently built on a popular and relatively light [GeneratePress base theme](https://generatepress.com/) (GPLv3) using the "Cloud" site template from it's [site library](https://generatepress.com/site-library/#site-library). Paid premium update license has been provided by [Netura](https://netura.fi/).

For more background on the site technology during big revamp in 2021 refer to blog post and linked with video demo https://jyv채skyl채.hacklab.fi/2021/12/10/virtuaalinen-yhteisomiitti-2021/.

# WP layout technology reconsiderations for 2024

This repository is mostly empty because the layout is produced by a wysiwyg "site builder" storing it's configuration to database in traditional "CMS" way of doing HTML easily, which is not very GIT- or developer friendly way which is praicing for "configuration-as-code" and other methodologies that picked up steam long after WordPress was made. 

A GIT/developer friendly layout framework https://timber.github.io/docs/v2/ is currently being considered, which gives more developer oriented workflow for PHP web development involving WordPress as the backend.


# Issue tracker
[Issue tracker](https://github.com/HacklabJKL/site/issues) linked to this repository is loosely up to date and does not take into account latest technology reconsiderations and some older tasks may become irrelevant.

There is also a old issue tracker online as this repository was made by accident as new during previous WP technology upgrade efforts.

# Development environment

Vagrant development environment with live site sync scripts and some documentation is provided at https://github.com/HacklabJKL/VVV. VVV is long running project and has nearly everything required for development while it can seem a bit heavy and monolithic (and more tied to AMD64). It's still a very active open source project with developers keeping it up to date and responding to guestions in support channels.

Maximum beginners can also leverage https://localwp.com/ for nearly same effect but need to modify sync scripts written for VVV (not very hard).

Container users can try out eg. WP-ENV (docker wrapper utility in NPM) https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-env/ but lacks features compared to VVV and adds some complexity of it's own for doing basic things.
